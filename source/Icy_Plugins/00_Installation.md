	Warning: if your icy background appears black instead of grey, the plugins will be affected an unsolved memory leak. Most reported cases appear in co-occurrence with Apple RetinaÂ® screens.
	
	Temporary Fix: Use an external monitor with the macbook lid closed

### Install the required plugins for icy
---

In order to run the EpiTools plugins, only one additional icy plugin is required, [EzPlug](http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/plugin/EzPlug-SDK). This is a plugin which facilitates the building of graphical user interfaces and is used by all EpiTools Plugins. To install it simply write in the icy search field the following plugin name [network connection required]:

* EzPlug SDK (most likely already installed)
* 3D Mesh ROI (only for the CellSurface plugin)

2. You will be asked to locate the **folder test** from the download package
3. Shortely after a new viewer should be visualized (image below)
